This is a simple script that will add a new circle next to water status with the weight from player's inventory.
this is customized for my server but it's very easy to change.

line 75 is the circle's color
line 76 the icon in the circle (from https://fontawesome.com/)

At line 1 change the 'maxWeight' to your max weight. (on grams)

Make sure you will start this script after trew_hud_ui

I didn't did all this by my self, i read the tutorial from original trew_hud_ui about how to add extra status.
